# iOS-ARKit

***This repository contains the code for making an ARDrawing using ARKit.***

# Requirements

* XCode 9

* iPhone [6/6S,7/7+/7 SE,8/8+, X]

* Apple Developer Account


# Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Go inside the ARDrawing folder and execute the xcodeprojext file.

3. This should build the code and install the app onto your phone.

4. Launch the app till you get the world origin.

5. Once you get the World Origin, focus the camera onto a Horizontal surface as that is the surface on which our ARDrawing will be Augmented.

6. Once the app displays "Plane Detected", tap on the screen and 'voila', the ARDrawing is in front of you.

Here's a quick demo of how this app works:
